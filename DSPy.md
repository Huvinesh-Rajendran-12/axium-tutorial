# DSPy Best Practices and Agent Implementation

This document provides a summary of best practices for using the DSPy framework and a guide on how to implement agents with it.

## DSPy Best Practices

DSPy is a framework for programming language models (LMs). Instead of manually tuning prompts, you define the structure of your pipeline, and DSPy's optimizers tune the prompts and model weights for you.

### Core Concepts

*   **Signatures**: Define the input and output for a specific task. Keep descriptions clear but concise to allow for optimization.
*   **Modules**: The building blocks of a DSPy program (e.g., `dspy.Predict`, `dspy.ChainOfThought`, `dspy.ReAct`).
*   **Optimizers (formerly Teleprompters)**: Algorithms that tune your DSPy program to maximize a given metric.

### Development Best Practices

*   **Start Simple**: Begin with a zero-shot module to establish a baseline.
*   **Data Preparation**: High-quality and representative training data is crucial for optimization.
*   **Choosing an Optimizer**: The choice of optimizer depends on your dataset size and goals.
    *   `BootstrapFewShot`: Good for small datasets (~10 examples).
    *   `BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch`: For larger datasets (50+ examples).
    *   `MIPROv2`: For optimizing instructions for a zero-shot prompt.
*   **Iterative Process**: Experiment with different modules, signatures, and optimizers.
*   **Caching**: Use `dspy.settings.configure(cache_dir=...)` to save time and cost.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

*   **Over-detailing Signatures**: Avoid being too specific in signature descriptions to allow for better optimization.
*   **Signature Mismatch**: Ensure the signature matches the module's inputs and outputs.
*   **Ignoring Documentation**: The official DSPy documentation and GitHub are valuable resources.

### Advanced Techniques

*   **Assertions**: Use `dspy.Assert` and `dspy.Suggest` to define constraints and guide the model's output.
*   **Deployment**: Use FastAPI for lightweight services or MLflow for production-grade deployments.
*   **Custom Modules**: Create custom modules for unique tasks.

## Implementing Agents with DSPy

DSPy simplifies the creation of complex systems like agents and RAG pipelines.

### Core Concepts for Agents

*   **Signatures**: Define the agent's input and output (e.g., `question -> answer`).
*   **Modules**: `dspy.ReAct` is commonly used for building agents, following a "Reasoning and Acting" approach.
*   **Tools**: Functions that the agent can use to interact with the outside world (e.g., search, calculation, APIs).
*   **Optimizer**: Automatically improves prompts and weights for better performance.

### Steps to Implement an Agent

1.  **Set up your environment**: Install DSPy and configure your language model.
2.  **Define your tools**: Create Python functions with clear docstrings.
3.  **Define the agent's signature**: Specify the agent's inputs and outputs.
4.  **Create the agent**: Use a module like `dspy.ReAct` and provide it with the defined tools.
5.  **Use the agent**: Give the agent a task to complete.

### Example: Simple ReAct Agent

```python
import dspy

# 1. Define the tools
def search(query: str) -> str:
    """Searches for information."""
    # In a real application, this would call a search API
    return f"Information about {query}"

def math(expression: str) -> float:
    """Performs a math calculation."""
    return eval(expression)

# 2. Set up the language model
llm = dspy.OpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo')
dspy.configure(lm=llm)

# 3. Create the ReAct agent
class MyAgent(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.react = dspy.ReAct([search, math])

    def forward(self, question):
        return self.react(question=question)

# 4. Use the agent
agent = MyAgent()
result = agent(question="What is 2 + 2?")
print(result.answer)
```

### Advanced Concepts for Agents

*   **Optimization**: Use the DSPy optimizer with a dataset of examples to improve the agent's performance.
*   **Multi-agent systems**: Create complex systems with collaborating agents.
*   **Tracing**: Use tools like MLflow to trace the agent's execution for debugging.
